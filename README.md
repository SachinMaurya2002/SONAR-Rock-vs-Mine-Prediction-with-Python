# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction

Overview

Welcome to the SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction project! This repository contains a Python application that uses machine learning to predict whether an object in the ocean is a rock or a mine based on SONAR signals. This project aims to enhance underwater object detection using advanced classification techniques.

Features:-

Accurate Predictions: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for high accuracy.
User Input: Allows users to input SONAR signal data to classify the object.

Detailed Analysis: Provides comprehensive reports and visualizations of the prediction results.

Algorithms Used:-

Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective linear model for binary classification.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method used for classification based on feature similarity.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that works well with high-dimensional data.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

Dataset:-

We used the SONAR Rock vs Mine Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
